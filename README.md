## Why are screenshots useful?
- screenshots act as evidence
- they can help debug problems
- if we have a test step that fails, we'd want to see visual evidence as to why it failed
- screenshots are important from a reporting perspective, as they give context behind a failure
- we can give screenshots files a specific name to prevent file overwrite
