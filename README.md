## BROWSER TAB
- browsers allow you to have more than one window open at a time
- for example, on one tab you might be looking up something on a search engine, while on the other, you might have a news website open
- if we want interact with another tab using Selenum Webdriver, then we need to instruct the driver to "switch to" the window
